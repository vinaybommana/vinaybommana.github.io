Today I've started learning violin. I think my violin teacher is giving
lessons the indian way. The strings are named `1, 2, 3, 4`, rather than
`E, A, D, G` - the normal standard. The `swara`, `note` in telugu way are

    sa , ri, ga, ma

    pa, dha, ni, sa.

The fingering positions are slightly different from the
normal first position I've seen.

These are the fingering positions:

`sa`
open `A` string
![sa](/images/_sa.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

`ri`
![ri](/images/ri.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

`ga`
![ga](/images/ga.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

`ma`
![ma](/images/ma.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

`pa`
open `E` string
![pa](/images/pa.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}


`dha`
![dha](/images/dha.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}


`ni`
![ni](/images/ni.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

`sa`*
![sa*](/images/sa.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}


The practice exercise for just playing the violin is just
using bow on `sa` and `pa` for 20 times without gaps,
for now, I am doing a bad job not delaying and changing
the `A` and `E` string at once easily

for a song each part consists of four notes,

My first practice song is simple

1. 

```
	sa  ri  ga  ma  , pa  dha  ni  sa*
	sa* ni  dha pa  , ma  ga   ri  sa
```

2.

```
	sa  ri  ga  ma,  sa  ri  ga  ma,  sa  ri  ga  ma, pa  dha  ni  sa*
	sa*  ni  dha  pa,  sa*  ni  dha  pa,  sa*  ni  dha  pa, ma  ga  ri  sa
```
