Let's Dance with Python

When I say let's dance, I meant the dance pertaining to The Game of Thrones with swords, axes and Dragon glass.
This series focuses on web scraping and data analysing using python. Let's take what we know about Python and fight the war against web Others and White Walkers.

This series - we can say tutorials right? - consists of hopefully three sub-parts because If I say everything in One single post, Even I will be bored reading it.

    The first part consists of basics in Python language.
    The second part consists of basics in scraping.
    The third part consists of data analysing.


For the tutorial to be eventful, the prerequisite is to know a bit about python. I will be using Python 3.5.2 and a bunch of libraries which you will know in the run. When I say a bit of python don't go off and think that this is not for you because you know only C.
Python is easier and much more fun than C.

For sparking Interest I will be giving spoilers to you.

In the first one there will be introduction to some python and html.

Then, I will tell you what scraping is and how to scrape a website and gather the html content from it and use it for manifesting it into something useful.

In the third tutorial, We will use the scraped data from the website and depict the data we extracted into graphs.

As you people are well  versed with C,  we know that stdio.h, math.h are header files to be included to use the functions somebody has written to our use like printf(), sqrt(). Concurrently, Python also has libraries - so many of them - which we will use for our convenience and usage.

The libraries I'll be using are:

    requests
    BeautifulSoup
    matplotlib


The other in-built libraries, I am not mentioning because the above stated libraries should be downloaded from internet before you can scrape and analyse the data.

I'll talk much more about them in-detail in the coming tutorial. Behold for the next one.

So don't get bored. We'll do some fun stuff.


At the end, we'll produce such type of graphs.
