## [Contains Spoilers]

To put it foolishly IT is about a bunch of kids who tried to do
homework assigned to them by the `Other` fails the first time
tries again 27 years later and then succeeds - or they think 
they did. The homework is, killing the being that haunts the 
town of Derry, Maine from a long time.

The Novel starts with a small boy - George Denborough - playing
on a stormy morning with a paper boat made by his brother,
Bill Denborough - who is sort of the hero of this novel.

As in any horror novel, George is killed by Pennywise the clown
by amputating off his hand from the body. The Scene is horrifying
give it a read. This is the start of long list of events that happen in
Derry on 1958.

The story comes back and forth between 1958 and 1985 walks through how,
Bill and his friends - The Losers Club - come together defeating their own
devils and try to kill It.

Big Bill -- The Unprecedented Leader of the Club
Ben -- The building and execution guy whatever losers think, he executes
Bev -- The only girl in the club, sort of heroine in the Novel
       but mind you she's not a damsel in distress.
Eddie -- The compass of the Losers, guy holds an aspirator always
Mike -- The black boy in the club, sort of strong character here
Stan -- The Jewish guy, sort of weak guy
Richie -- The Infamous Richie Trashmouth, the humour comes from this guy


There are several characters in the novel other than these guys like the skateboard
kid, Bill's wife, Bev's husband Tom etcetera. But the above are the main ones
the story moves around.

I am not going for a summary here, don't expect it, I am just ranting about the greatness
of this book and how incredible stephen king is a story teller.

Mind you, `IT` creeps you up. There are literally nightmares where I am running through
an abandoned corridor and someone is chasing me with squishy slippers and shoes. I would
always wake up with penny wise's face laughing maniacally.

The Book in some ways is a window towards your childhood. King captures the perfect childhood
we used to feel. The horrors in the dark, how we used to get scared in the night about the unseen
ghosts.

He captures the childhood insecurities. our friends, how we used to bond with them and share our
deepest secrets and cookies. The Book captures everything.

Character development in King's novel is so smooth and well written that we think that the guy
is actually feeling the pain and fear.

The scenes with Beverly and Tom will always be imprinted on my mind. When Tom dies looking at the 
deadlights, I gave a whoop - literally.
