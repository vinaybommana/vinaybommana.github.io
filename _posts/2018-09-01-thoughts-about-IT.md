## [Contains Spoilers]

To put it foolishly IT is about a bunch of kids who tried to do
homework assigned to them by the `Other` fails the first time
tries again 27 years later and then succeeds - or they think 
they did. The homework is, killing the being that haunts the 
town of Derry, Maine from a long time.

The Novel starts with a small boy - George Denborough - playing
on a stormy morning with a paper boat made by his brother,
Bill Denborough - who is sort of the hero of this novel.

As in any horror novel, George is killed by Pennywise the clown
by amputating off his hand from the body. The Scene is horrifying
give it a read. This is the start of long list of events that happen in
Derry on 1958.

The story comes back and forth between 1958 and 1985 walks through how,
Bill and his friends - The Losers Club - come together defeating their own
devils and try to kill It.

* Big Bill -- The Unprecedented Leader of the Club
* Ben -- The building and execution guy whatever losers think, he executes
* Bev -- The only girl in the club, sort of heroine in the Novel
       but mind you she's not a damsel in distress.
* Eddie -- The compass of the Losers, guy holds an aspirator always
* Mike -- The black boy in the club, sort of strong character here
* Stan -- The Jewish guy, sort of weak guy
* Richie -- The Infamous Richie Trashmouth, the humour comes from this guy


There are several characters in the novel other than these guys like the skateboard
kid, Bill's wife, Bev's husband Tom etcetera. But the above are the main ones
the story moves around.

I am not going for a summary here, don't expect it, I am just ranting about the greatness
of this book and how incredible stephen king is, as a story teller.

Mind you, `IT` creeps you up. There are literally nightmares where I am running through
an abandoned corridor and someone is chasing me with squishy slippers and shoes. I would
always wake up with penny wise's face laughing maniacally.

The Book in some ways is a window towards your childhood. King captures the perfect childhood
we used to feel. The horrors in the dark, how we used to get scared in the night about the unseen
ghosts.

He captures the childhood insecurities. our friends, how we used to bond with them and share our
deepest secrets and cookies. The Book captures everything.

Character development in King's novel is so smooth and well written that we think that the guy
is actually feeling the pain and fear.

The scenes with Beverly and Tom will always be imprinted on my mind. When Tom dies looking at the 
deadlights, I gave a whoop - literally.

There is something a single individual cannot do. But when we group together and starting working
on the problem, we realise this herculian task can't be done by a single individual. Not just
physically but emotionally as well. Everyone has their problems. Bill's loss. Beverly's pain
as her father is close to a psychopath and hurts her for smallest mistakes. Eddie's overprotective
mother. Stan's Jewish descent. Mike's a black guy and in 1958, people are not so liberal about
a coloured guy. Richie can't cope up with loneliness, that's why he uses his trashmouth to let
the silence away. Ben is the fat boy who everyone abuses, His infactuation towards Beverly.

There was a scene in the novel,
where the encounter It with a silver slug, after everything's over, Ben realises that the love
between Beverly and Bill is mutual. Ben thinks

{% highlight %}
*He can never love you as I did Beverly, that's for sure.*
{% endhighlight %}
I thought all the one side lovers in this world think that way, and was surprised, how 
king captured this feeling in a 11 year old boy that subtly.

There are several hundred such incredible scenes in the novel that are not filled 
with horror but with emotion.

King's genius is unparalled in this novel. Give it a read. You wouldn't regret it.
