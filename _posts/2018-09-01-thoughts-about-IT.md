## [Contains Spoilers]

To put it foolishly IT is about a bunch of kids who tried to do
homework assigned to them by the `Other` fails the first time
tries again 27 years later and then succeeds - or they think 
they did. The homework is killing the being that haunts the 
town of Derry, Maine from a long time.
