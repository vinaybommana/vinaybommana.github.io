Neovim's new cursor styling

NeoVim Changed the cursor styling from the single redundant block to different styles - like block in normal mode, underscore in replace mode,
and single line pipe type symbol in insert mode which I really like. Thank you NeoVim developers for that.

I feel the wheels under good old vim rolling towards the NeoVim station.

If you don't like it and want the terminal vim feel again.
